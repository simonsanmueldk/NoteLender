# NoteLender

Semester Project 3 by Esben Fogh, Krzysztof Pacierz, Dorin Pascal and Simon Samuel

  The major purpose of the project was to develop aheterogeneous,multi-user system, which provides user-friendly software that will allow them to share notes between them.Users can register an account, see their groups, and accept or decline invitations in easy steps .The system allows user to create, edit, and removenotes while providing convenient and efficient design. 
  Based on the user stories, a list of requirements has been made. After analyzing requirements, the next step is todesign the system. All requirements had been deduced and subsequently, analysis with UML diagrams was developed. The whole system has been written in .NET and JAVA, with exception of the database that was written in SQL.
  The persistence layer is responsible for storing the data in the system and is based on relative databases, which are a solid and efficient solution.In the Businesslayer, which acts as a connectorbetween persistence and presentation layer, the logic of the systemis implemented. Presentation layer is responsible for displaying the collected information and interacts with the user.
