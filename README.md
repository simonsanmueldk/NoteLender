# NoteLender

Semester Project 3 by Esben Fogh, Krzysztof Pacierz, Dorin Pascal and Simon Samuel

   The major purpose of the project was to develop a multi-user system, which provides user-friendly software that will allow them to share notes between them.

   The system allows user to create, edit, and remove notes while providing convenient and efficient design. Users can register an account, see their groups, and accept or decline invitations reservation in easy steps. Based on the user stories, a list of requirements has been made. 

   After analyzing requirements, the next step is the design of the system. The data persistence layer is responsible for storing all the data in the system and is based on relative databases, which are a solid and efficient solution. All requirements had been deduced and subsequently, analysis with UML diagrams was developed. The whole system has been written in .NET and JAVA, with exception of the database that was written in SQL.
